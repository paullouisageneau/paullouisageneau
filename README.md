Some of my open source projects:

- [libdatachannel](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel): WebRTC and WebSockets C/C++ standalone library
- [datachannel-wasm](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/datachannel-wasm): C++ WebRTC Data Channels and WebSockets for WebAssembly
- [libjuice](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libjuice): Lightweight UDP Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) library
- [libplum](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libplum): Multi-protocol NAT Port Mapping client library
- [node-portmapping](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/node-portmapping): Node.js bindings for libplum
- [violet](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/violet): Lightweight STUN/TURN server
- [boost-asio-gnutls](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/boost-asio-gnutls): GnuTLS wrapper for Boost.Asio

I'm a contributor to [node-datachannel](https://github.com/murat-dogan/node-datachannel), Node.js bindings for [libdatachannel](https://libdatachannel.org/).

I've also been contributing to [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/), and [libtorrent](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent), in which I added WebTorrent support. This first native WebTorrent implementation opens exciting possibilities for Peer-to-Peer file exchanges between Web browsers and native clients!

Otherwise, I like working on robots and tinkering with [Minitels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel)! Check out [my blog](https://chapelierfou.org/) :robot:
